# # Does Consuming Water/Beverage Before, During, or After Meals Impact Your Caloric Intake?

# In todayâ€™s society, there are various social meida outlets that recommends us to follow ambiguous tips on how to maintain a healthy diet. One of them which caught our interest, was the encouragement of drinking lots of water throughout the day. Their reasoning was that it will provide many benefits to our bodies, and as well as reducing our appetite to prevent us from over consuming.

# We decided to investiage this topic in order to see if their claim will actually have an impact on our calorie intake. We came up with a research question to lead this investigation: Is there a relationship between drink consumption and caloric intake from meals?

# Our prediction on this claim is that, with an increased of water/beverage consumption, it will reduce our appetite and our overall caloric intake from our meals.

# Let us explore this claim together through our data and our process of interpretion to determine if there is a relations between water/beverage intake and number of calories consumed.

# ## LET US EXPLORE THE DATA

# Here is a sample of our raw data. As one would imagine, it is very difficult to visualize what this data would look like.

# This is the data we have collected over a 7 day period to be explored in depth in relation to our research question.

# There are multiple columns in this dataset but we are only interested in specific columns.

# The **Who**, **What**, **When**, and **Why**

# In[14]:

selection


# ## Who?
# The individuals who collected their own eating and drinking habits.

# In[15]:


fare_df['Name'].unique().tolist()


# ## What?
# What did we collect? </br>
# We collected data on the types of beverages consumed and the total number of calories per meal

# In[16]:


fare_df[['Types of drinks', 'Total calories in meal (cal)', 'Meal of the day']].sample(5)


# ### How did we calculate our calories? 
# We used an app called FatSecret. </br>
# As with most calorie tracker apps, there are a lot of variations and options available for counting calories. Total accuracy was not a concern for our data since we only need it to see if there are trends.

# ## When?
# The data collection period, October 13th to October 19th.</br>
# The time when we ate our meals at or when we drank water/beverage.

# In[17]:


fare_df[['Date', 'Time']].sample(5)


# ## Why?
# Why did we drink what we drank?</br>
# Could range from thirst, nutrition, habit, rinise, craving, unwinding, enjoyment, or taste

# For calories, it is a calculated average of the meals of the four members. As shown by the lime green bars of the bar chart.

# We are only counting the number of drinks consumed before meals.

# different meal of the day might have its own relation between the calorie intake and drink consumption

# We will take a specific look at our breakfast, lunch, and dinner to see if it has a unique trend

# It could affect the number of calories we consume

# # Conclusion

# Remember our predication at the beginning? We predicted that drinking more will reduce our appetite.
# Let us see if this was the case. 

# Through the exploration our data and visualizations together, we can conclude that there is no meaningful or supportive evidence that when we consume water/beverages have an impact on calorie consumption.

# There is one trend that we noticed is that there is that we drink and eat less in the mornings. 
# But then towards the end of the day, there is an increased of drink consumption and calorie intake.
# Which is quite an interesting insight.

# In conclusion, our assumption was wrong!

# Due to the limitations of the data and possible inaccuracy of our data collection process, we cannot definitively say that the water/beverage consumption will reduce our appetite as claimed by social media.
